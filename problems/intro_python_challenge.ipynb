    "`1` This question will rely on the documentation for input and output operations which can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-files.\n",
    "Write a function called even_copy() that will take in the name of a file as an input and copies only the even lines of that file to an output file. The input file has name \"data.txt\" the output file should be named \"copied_data.txt\" and should live in the same directory as the input file. It would be good practice to ensure that your function can handle edge cases such as, when the input file does not exist (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html), when the input file has nothing in it, or when the output file already exists. Test your code as much as you can by creating files and passing their names into your function. Bonus: Can you think of a way to make your function more general so that the user of the function can specify which lines they would like to copy of the input file?"
