    "### Simple SMILES\n",
    "\n",
    "SMILES are a popular text representation of molecules. They use a string of elements and bonds to encode the molecular structure, with hydrogens represented implicitly. For example, ethyl alcohol is encoded as \"CCO\". For this problem, we will use a simplified SMILES representation to encode linear Carbon chains with arbitrary functional groups. Here are the rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will only include C, O, N, F, and H.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If no bond is given, we will assume a single bond is formed. Double bonds are represented with = and triple bonds are represented with #. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. We will only encode linear chains of carbons. Any non-carbon atoms will be bonded to the preceding carbon. For example, carbonic acid is represented as COO=O. Though it might look like the final oxygen is bonded to the second oxygen, by this rule, it is bonded to the carbon.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hydrogens are represented implicitly and all atoms are neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CO: methyl alcohol\n",
    "- CFFCFF: polytetrafluoroethylene monomer\n",
    "- CCCCO: butanol\n",
    "- COO=O: carbonic acid\n",
    "- CCN: ethyl amine\n",
    "- CCCC#N: butyro nitride\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that calculates the number of bonds in a molecule from the smile.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT:** we can calculate the number of bonds by considering only the identify of each element. If we ignore the bond from the up-chain carbon, carbons form 3 bonds, nitrogen 2, oxygen 1, and fluorine 0. Similar logic can be applied to double and triple bonds.\n"

    "### Calculate Cycle Number\n",
    "\n",
    "We are performing an experiment that alternates voltage between 0 and 5 volts while recording information about our sample at each timestep. Each cycle is composed of a 0 voltage period and a high voltage period. We need to count the number of cycles for our analysis, but for unclear reasons, our instrument does not record the cycle number. Instead, we will need to infer the cycle number from the control voltage. Write a function that takes a list the control voltage at many timesteps and returns a list of the cycle number at each timestep. For example, our input might be:\n",
